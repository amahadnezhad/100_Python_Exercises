Exercise 52
Question: The code is supposed to ask the user to enter their name and surname,
          and then it prints out those user submitted values.
          Instead, the code throws a TypeError. Please fix it so that the expected output is printed out.

print("Your first name is %s and your second name is %s" % (first_name, second_name))
